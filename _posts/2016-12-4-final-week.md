title: Week 14 in OOP – Final Week

### Projects and Tools
The projects were useful because they allowed us to learn how to use tools to manage our code, documentation, testing, and collaboration. Docker could be a bit cumbersome at times but I think it’s an invaluable tool. Travis CI was very easy to set up and incorporate into each project. Doxygen, Gtest and gcov were, for me, the most useful tools we used in this course. Testing and documentation were almost automatic and I could definitely see myself using these on my own projects or in industry. 

The projects themselves were fun and solidified my C++ knowledge. However, I did think the Darwin project was more tedious than necessary and I didn’t feel I learned much by doing it. 

### Quizzes
The material tested on the quizzes was directly related to what we were learning in class which I very much appreciated. The quizzes were very tricky at times but completely fair. However, the fact that we could not miss quizzes for interviews seemed counter productive to this class. 

### Tests
I think the tests, in my opinion, did not properly test our learning. They seemed to be testing 1) how well we could type code in canvas 2) how fast we could read test cases and instructions 3) how fast we could scroll and 4) how well we could memorize code from class and tiny details that could be googled in the real world.
I thought the tests were very unfair and didn’t actually test us on how well we learned the material.

### Lectures
I thought the lectures were fun and engaging and I felt like I learned a lot about C++. I do think that when I would leave lecture there would be a lot of gaps in my knowledge and because of the way the class was taught it was difficult to even know what those gaps were. I think it would’ve been helpful to have had the topics been clearly stated when introduced in lecture(even the small topics).

### Overall
I really enjoyed the projects and lectures. I feel I now have a solid grasp on c++ and understand more fully the unique things that differentiate languages, particularly OOP languages.  I enjoyed using industry tools in our projects and appreciated the speakers from different companies that shared their experiences.
