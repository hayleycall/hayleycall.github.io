title: Week 8 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
I gave myself somewhat of a ‘free’ week this past week- this was a mistake. I have to turn in and finish everything by Tuesday so not using my free time was not the best idea- but at least I’m saner now. I’ve been reviewing material for my probability course pretty often because that class actually terrifies me. I’m trying my best to stay very focused in all my courses 100% of the time and I’m doing pretty well! I think I need to put in some good study hours and I will be pretty caught up in all of my classes (I got behind during test week). In other news, HackTX & Grace Hopper are coming up NEXT WEEK- wow time flies. Since I’m a HackTX director, I’ve been doing some last minute preparation for next weekend- it’s going to be a great event!

### What's in your way?
Well, since I won’t be here next week, I need to make sure I finish the majority of my work today and Monday, which isn’t an easy task. A lot of assignments are due on Wednesday and Thursday, including the OOP project, so I need to make sure I don’t get distracted from my work tomorrow and when I am at the Grace Hopper conference. 

### What will you do next week?
I’m going to continue to work on the OOP project, study for my Computer Networks test, and get several other assignments in. I’m also going to Grace Hopper (Tuesday-Saturday morning), one of my sorority’s events on Saturday and HackTX on Saturday and Sunday- wow it’s a pretty full week. 

### Tip of the Week?
Use the free tutoring offered here. Getting a tutor doesn’t mean you are stupid or can’t study on your own- it just means you are being proactive in making sure you understand class material. Probability is something that is not intuitive to me like it is to some people so I HAVE to go to office hours and tutoring to understand it. My friend (you know who you are) told me to go to tutoring so I scheduled some tutoring sessions at the [Sanger Learning Center]( https://ugs.utexas.edu/slc). They have both drop-in and one-on-one tutoring- check ‘em out. You are paying an insane amount for all the recourses UT has to offer so you may as well actually use them!
