title: Week 3 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
I finished the first OOP project! At first I was really wary of configuring Travis.CI and Docker to run and test the project correctly, but it was worth struggling through it because I learned a lot. In class, we've been learning about references and pointers in C++ as well as the difference between right and left hand values. What I've learned so far is that C++ is a lot more flexible than Java. In Java, references and pointers aren't a thing so you have to use return values everywhere. 
In other news, I dropped my French class (before q period started thank goodness). It was a sad but good decision. I can now handle all of my other classes whereas before I was very short on time. 
I'm still planning and doing outreach for HackTX- registration opens up September 16th at 6:00p.m. Everyone should apply!



### What's in your way?
As previously mentioned, we are learning about references and pointers in OOP. We have been discussing when using them improperly may cause a compile-time or run-time error. I'm still pretty behind on knowing these concepts. I plan to read some articles on C++ references and pointers. This will ensure I have a rock solid understanding of how best to use the language.
I'm currently applying to study abroad in the Spring (Scotland hopefully) and the deadline for the application is Sept. 15. So, because I've been working on that I don't have enough time for my classes. But as soon as the deadline passes, I will be more relaxed and caught up in my course work. It'll be worth it- I've never been to Europe! 


### What will you do next week?
I'm going to learn as much as I can about references and pointers in C++. I'm going to turn in my study abroad application. I'm going to get people to register for HackTX. I'll start on the next OOP project. 


### Tip of the Week?
Going with the theme of learning about references and pointers, I stumbled upon this great tutorial: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/
