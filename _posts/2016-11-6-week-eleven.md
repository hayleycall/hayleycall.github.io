title: Week 11 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
I, along with my OOP partner, finished up the Darwin project. This project was by far the hardest of the year and we underestimated how much time it would actually take. I also went home this weekend (which I rarely do) to celebrate my hometown’s German festival, ‘Wurstfest.’ It was great seeing my extended family and old friends.  On Sunday I was not looking forward to getting back into the grind of homework and more homework. 

### What's in your way?
The next project is due in 2 weeks and I’ve got my most important test of the semester in 2 weeks. I need to make sure I’m giving time to both. 

There are some concepts in OOP (ex. constructors) that I still don’t understand and writing a small program to figure them out does not work at all for me. I need to find a better way to learn the material as I do want to become more knowledgeable in C++.

### What will you do next week?
I’ll be studying for my probability test coming up as well as working on the current OOP project. I’ll also be wrapping up last minute study-abroad forms. I’m going to start thinking out my travel plans for next semester and I’ll schedule my flights so that I’m not paying a small fortune last minute. 

### Tip of the Week?
I’m going to give general life advice this week.
It’s difficult to motivate yourself to complete work each day when you’re not sure what you want to accomplish in your career. I’ve struggled with regretting not double majoring, not joining the military, and not applying for things I may have been interested in. I remind myself that my dream job isn’t just going to happen right after you graduate. People spend their whole lives figuring out what they really love to do and then going after it. If you are struggling with which career path you are going to follow just remember that you have time and it’s better to keep searching then to land in a job that you don’t like and become comfortable (not in a good way) in. It’s ok to want sometime different than what you always thought you wanted.  The only mistake you can make is not taking a risk to follow your dreams.
