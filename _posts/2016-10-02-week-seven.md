title: Week 6 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
It was test week- and not just in OOP. The early part of the week I was studying up for my tests and finishing up some assignments. I thought the test was pretty fair- I wish I would have studied differently though- more memorizing code would have been helpful. I guess I'll know what to study for the next test. After all my tests were over (Thursday night), I watched some Netflix to relax before the next round of assignments (Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a really good show). I also continued with my study abroad application and am currently trying to figure out if I can get credit for the courses I will be taking in Scotland. 

### What's in your way?
There just always seems to be so little time and so much to do. It seems that when I have more to do, I procrastinate exponentially more. I need to learn how to finish things bit by bit and prioritize more.  This upcoming week contains a lot of deadlines and hopefully I can manage my time in a way that I won’t be overcome with stress. 
 
### What will you do next week?
I’m going to work on the upcoming project in OOP and turn in my assignments for 3 other courses. I’ll also finish up my study abroad application and hopefully have a pretty good idea of what courses I’ll be taking abroad. I also need to complete the FAFSA, as now it comes out in October- this is pretty important intel for those of you who apply for financial aid. 

### Tip of the Week?
I have a couple tips for this week. First is a bit of food advice: don’t let your food go bad because you’ve forgotten about it and/or bought too much at one time. Otherwise you won’t have any food and you’ll have to buy food from the union or the SAC and that can get really expensive not to mention unhealthy. 
The second piece of advice is more technical. If you are interested in cyber security, specifically penetration testing, you should check out this book: [Google Hacking for Penetration Testers]( https://www.amazon.com/Google-Hacking-Penetration-Testers-Third/dp/0128029641). It was recommended to me by one of the sponsors I, along with the other ISSS officers, brought in to talk about penetration testing. This book also teaches you how to be very good at web searching- which is, in my opinion, one of the most important skills to have as a software developer.
