title: Week 12 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
I’ve been pretty sick for the past week, so I mostly coughed and slept. Unfortunately, this meant that I got behind in all of my classes (luckily not too far).  I have a very important test on Tuesday morning so I’ve been trying my best to be prepared for that despite my cold.  

### What's in your way?
Other than the cold, not much. And as usual, there’s never enough time in a day to get everything done in order to be stress free. 

I’m still somewhat confused by some of the inheritance concepts we’ve been learning in class (OOP). Once I review some online tutorials I should be up to speed. 

### What will you do next week?
I’m starting to plan my study abroad experience for next semester. I’ve already been accepted to the school and picked out my classes. I still need to plan flights and choose my housing.  I’m extremely excited. I’ve never left North America so I’m ready for this new adventure. 

### Tip of the Week?
When you are studying or just trying to get a lot of things done in one sitting, never fragment your work. What I mean by that is if you have a lot of material to go over for class A and class B for example, don’t do this:
1.	Work on Class A for 1 hour
2.	Work on Class B for 1 hour
3.	Work on Class A for 1 hour
4.	Work on Class B for 1 hour
Etc.
Instead do all of class A’s work in one go followed with all of class B’s work. This may seem like common sense but you still may not actually be following this rule in your daily life. It prevents you from forgetting material right after you’ve learned it and you’ll finish tasks completely instead of having a lot of tasks that are half way done. You’ll feel more accomplished and be more productive.
