title: Week 13 in OOP
---

### What did you do this past week?
Finished up the Life OOP project and took the test I’ve been anxious about for the past month. Thankfully, I think it went pretty well. I’ve also been wrapping up last minute errands and projects so that I won’t have to do a lot of homework during Thanksgiving. In class, we’ve been talking about inheritance, abstract classes and other classic OOP principles. 

### What's in your way?
There are still some OOP concepts I need to gain a better understanding of. A couple of hours on youtube and looking at our code from class should do the trick.
I also need to make sure I don’t lose motivation during and after Thanksgiving. 


### What will you do next week?
I’m going to start prepping for my 4 finals and will start on the extra credit project for this class… but most importantly…
Thanksgiving! My family is coming in from across the country so I’m very excited to see them (esp. my twin sister). My family is very small compared to most. We are also very close so I love getting to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with them. 
Next semester will be upon us soon and I’ll be in Scotland! I need to plan so many things before I go and I should’ve started like yesterday.

### Tip of the Week?
Oldie but goodie if you need to brush up on [linux ](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/). This is where I first learned how to use the command line and I refer to it every once in awhile when I forget some basic syntax.
